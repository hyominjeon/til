# Scrum

### What is Scrum

* Scrum is a simple, iterative, and incremental agile framework for managing product development.
* Scrum accepts that customers' wants and needs can change during product development and that the problem cannot be fully defined.
* Scrum focuses on delivering quickly to respond to new requirements, technologies, and market conditions.
* Every sprint should potentially deliver something shippable.

### How it works

1. Product Owner creates a product backlog, a primritized wish list.
2. Sprint Planning: Team creates a sprint backlog by pulling a small chunk from the top of the product backlog, and decides how to implement.

3. Team sets a sprint - a time-boxed period (usually 2-4 weeks) - to complete the work.

4. Daily Scrum/Standup: Team meets everyday, no longer than 15 minutes, to quickly and transparently assess the progress by answering these questions:
   * What did I do yesterday?
   * What will I do today?
   * What are the blockers?

5. Sprint review: Team present the completed work during the Sprint.

6. Retrospective: Team meets for the last time for the Sprint to determine what did/didn't go well and how can the team improve in the next Sprint.

7. Go to #2 and repeat until the product backlog is completed, budget is depleted, or a deadline arrives.
